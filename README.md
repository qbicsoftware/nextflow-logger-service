## Run flowstore

flowstore is bundled as an executable jar, so you can just start the application with:

```bash
java -jar nfxlogger-<version>.jar
```

Keep in mind that this will run the flowstore with the [default configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qbicsoftware/nextflow-logger-service/master/src/main/resources/application.yml) setup.

You can pass your own configuration file with:

```bash
java -Dmicronaut.config.files=myconfig.yml -jar nfxlogger-<version>.jar
```

## Development

flowstore's dependencies are managed with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Clone the code from GitHub and checkout the `development` branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:qbicsoftware/nextflow-logger-service.git
git checkout --track origin/development
```

Be sure you have Maven installed on your system and that the application is in your system `PATH`, otherwise the following commands will not work.

Open your terminal and verify the Maven installation. This will look different on your system, but should output the installed Maven version:

```
> mvn --version
