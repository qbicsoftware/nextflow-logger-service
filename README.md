## Run flowstore

flowstore is bundled as an executable jar, so you can just start the application with:

```bash
java -jar nfxlogger-<version>.jar
```

Keep in mind that this will run the flowstore with the [default configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qbicsoftware/nextflow-logger-service/master/src/main/resources/application.yml) setup.

You can pass your **own configuration** file with:

```bash
java -Dmicronaut.config.files=myconfig.yml -jar nfxlogger-<version>.jar
```

The default **port** bound is `8080`. If you want to change that, you can pass the micronaut property like this:

```bash
java -Dmicronaut.server.port=8081 -jar nxflogger-<version>.jar
```


## Development

flowstore's dependencies are managed with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Clone the code from GitHub and checkout the `development` branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:qbicsoftware/nextflow-logger-service.git
git checkout --track origin/development
```

Be sure you have Maven installed on your system and that the application is in your system `PATH`, otherwise the following commands will not work.

Open your terminal and verify the Maven installation. This will look different on your system, but should output the installed Maven version:

```
> mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.6.0 (97c98ec64a1fdfee7767ce5ffb20918da4f719f3; 2018-10-24T20:41:47+02:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.6.0/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_181, vendor: Azul Systems, Inc., runtime: /Users/sven1103/.sdkman/candidates/java/8.0.181-zulu/jre
Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.14.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

### Compile

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

### Run unit tests

```bash
mvn clean test
```

### Run integration tests

```
mvn clean verify
```

### Create executable jar

This will create an executable jar in your current working directory under `./target`.

```
mvn clean package
```

## Configure

Flowstore comes with a default configuration and variable placeholders that can be defined by the system environment. 

```yaml
micronaut:
    application:
        name: nxflogger
    router:
        static-resources:
            swagger:
                paths: classpath:META-INF/swagger
                mapping: /swagger/**
contact:
    first-name: ${wf-contact-first-name:Max}
    last-name: ${wf-contact-last-name:Mustermann}
    email: ${wf-contact-email:'max.mustermann@uni-tuebingen.de'}
database:
    name: workflows
datasources:
        default:
            url: jdbc:mariadb://${wf-db-host}/${wf-db-name}?maxPoolSize=150&pool
            username: ${wf-db-user}
            password: ${wf-db-pwd}
            driverClassName: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
endpoints:
    health:
        enabled: true
        sensitive: false
        details-visible: ANONYMOUS
```

This basic configuration can be used, if you have a MariaDB instance as data source. The default `WeblogStorage` interface implementation is for MariaDB, so if you want to use a different backend database, you need to change the driver and provide an own implementation of this interface.

## Endpoints

### GET /workflows

Returns a JSON with a list of all stored workflow basic run information.

### POST /workflows

Expects a JSON weblog payload from Nextflow and stores it.

### GET /workflows/info/{runId}

Returns basic workflow run information for workflow with a given run id.

### GET /workflows/traces/{runId}

Returns detailed Nextflow trace information for a workflow with a given run id.

### GET /workflows/metadata/{runId}

Returns detailed workflow metadata such as parameter settings, input files and manifest information.
